# **Getting Started with Nginx 2.0**

Welcome to Nginx 2.0, an event-driven web server designed for efficiency, scalability, and compliance with the HTTP/1.1 standard. This guide will walk you through the steps to install and build Nginx 2.0 on your system.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- A Linux or macOS operating system
- The Clang compiler (clang++) installed
- Makefile support

## **Installation**

Nginx 2.0 uses a Makefile for building from source. Follow these steps to clone the repository and build the server:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    
    Start by cloning the Nginx 2.0 repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anassajaanan/Nginx-2.0
    
    cd nginx-2.0
    ```
    
    
2. **Build the Project**
    
    You can build the project in two configurations: **debug** for development and **release** for production.
    
    - **Debug Build:**
        
        The debug build includes additional debug symbols and is compiled with address and undefined behavior sanitizers (on macOS) or with strong protection and overflow checks (on Linux) for development and testing purposes.
        
        ```bash
        make debug
        ```
        
    - **Release Build:**
        
        The release build is optimized for performance with **`-O3`** optimization, native architecture targeting, and link-time optimization. This is the recommended configuration for deployment.
        
        ```bash
        make prod
        ```
        
3. **Running Nginx 2.0**
    
    To start the server, specify a configuration file path if desired. If no path is provided, the server will use the default configuration located at  **`[conf/nginx.conf]`**
    
    ```bash
    ./webserver [configfile_path]  # For release build
    ```
    
    Replace **`[configfile_path]`** with the path to your configuration file. If omitted, Nginx 2.0 will use the default configuration.
    
	 For a debug build:
    
    ```bash
    ./webserver_debug [configfile_path]  # For debug build
    ```

    

## **Clean Build**

To clean up build artifacts and start fresh, use the **`clean`** or **`fclean`** commands:

- **Clean Objects and Dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    
- **Full Clean (Including Binaries):**
    
    ```bash
    make fclean
    ```
    

## **Advanced Usage**

- **Valgrind Memory Check:**
    
    For Linux users, run your debug build with Valgrind to check for memory leaks:
    
    ```bash
    make valgrind
    ```
    
    Ensure Valgrind is installed on your system for this to work.
